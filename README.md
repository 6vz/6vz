âœ¨ I am a student in computer science, a graphic designer, UI/UX Designer, and I sometimes write programs in Python. I am currently learning React, and expanding my current knowledge of programming

I really enjoy going for walks or cycling, especially at evening/night times. I own one dog who I also enjoy going out with, at similar times. I enjoy programming and would like to associate my future with it. In my spare time, I do amateur video recording or photography, or photo processing in Photoshop most of the time.
